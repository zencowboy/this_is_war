Project 1 exercise: Basic War card game with a few "bells and whistles" using HTML, CSS, and JS.

##Rules of the game:
When a new game is started, the deck (52 cards) is shuffled and each player is dealt half the deck (26 cards). Each player flips the top card from their deck at the same time to reveal it. Whoever has the highest card gets to put both cards on the bottom of their own deck. If the numbers are the same they go to war;  the players each place four cards from the top of their deck face-up on the card table. Whichever player has the highest sum wins all of the face-up cards. If the two sums are the same then the process is repeated. A player wins when the other player has no cards left to play.
